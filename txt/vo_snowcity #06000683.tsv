2) On the way to the target, Yuki ran ahead. Now she and Mugen are separated.
3) As they reunite, Mugen is displeased, but not angry (tough but fair).
4) We learn that Yuki grew up on the streets. She fears her origins are a problem.
5) Mugen tells her that he values peoples skill and character, not their origin.
6) They must steal documents from an official. The target is guarded by samurai.
8) Mugen causes a distraction so that Yuki can pickpockets the official.
9) The team escapes in a wagon. Mugen tells Yuki she is now part of the team."
